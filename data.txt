reference
When a variable is declared as a reference, it becomes an alternative name for an existing variable. A variable can be declared as a reference by putting ‘&’ in the declaration.
int x = 10; int& ref = x;
inter
array
a collection of similar data types stored under the same name.
int arr[5] = {19, 10, 5, 6, 14};
intro
loops
"while" loop: while(x < 10){std::cout<<x<<std::endl}
inter
pointer
In C++, all variables must be stored somewhere within the host computer’s memory. To help programs find these variables without searching the memory, C++ allows us to use the special variable, pointers, to explicitly give the variable’s address.
int x=10; int* ptr = &x;
